Detection Accuracy: 96.7%
Note: These metrics can be customized based on your actual performance evaluations.


## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
During the testing process, the test samples is anticipated and contrasted with the genuinelabel. Applying the CNN model to the FER13 dataset yields an overall accuracy of 87.78%, just under the CK+ accuracy of 99%. With the FER13 dataset, we apply the SVM model and obtain an overall accuracy of 38%, which is lower than the CK+ accuracy of 97%. It is evident from comparisons to cutting-edge results that the generated custom CNN offers good accuracy while being less sophisticated in terms of network depth and parameters. However, there is room to experiment with the stlandard CNN design, deeper CNN networks, or other methods to increase accuracy.Sample Coding.
